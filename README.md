Project Overview: Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
Objective:
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based tool designed to help users understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. It allows users to adjust the size of the array and the speed of the visualization, making it easier to observe how each algorithm processes the data.

Tech Stack:
HTML: Provides the structure of the web page, including the layout of the header, section, and footer.
CSS: Used for styling the visualizer, including the layout of the array and buttons, and the overall design of the page.
JavaScript: Handles the logic and functionality of the application, including generating arrays, sorting them using different algorithms, and visualizing the sorting process.
Key Functionalities:
User Interface:

Array Size Adjustment: Users can change the size of the array using a range slider, which dynamically updates the array displayed on the screen.
Algorithm Speed Adjustment: A slider allows users to control the speed at which the sorting process is visualized.
Generate New Array: A button to generate a new random array, resetting the visualizer for a fresh demonstration.
Algorithm Buttons: Buttons for each sorting algorithm (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap) allow users to choose which algorithm they want to visualize.
Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort: Visualizes the Bubble Sort algorithm, where the array is sorted by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
Selection Sort: Visualizes the Selection Sort algorithm, which repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
Insertion Sort: Visualizes the Insertion Sort algorithm, which builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into the correct position.
Merge Sort: Visualizes the Merge Sort algorithm, a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively splits the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
Quick Sort: Visualizes the Quick Sort algorithm, another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot, recursively sorting the sub-arrays.
Heap Sort: Visualizes the Heap Sort algorithm, which builds a max heap from the array and repeatedly extracts the maximum element, rebuilding the heap until the array is sorted.
Visualization:

The visualizations are handled by the visualizations.js script, which dynamically updates the DOM to display the current state of the array after each operation within the sorting algorithms.
Bars representing array elements are animated in real-time to show how the array is being sorted by the selected algorithm.
The speed of the visualization is controlled by the user, allowing them to slow down or speed up the sorting process.
Workflow:
Initial Setup:

The HTML page sets up the structure with a header, a section for the array visualization, and a footer containing the algorithm buttons.
The main.js script initializes the array and handles user inputs like array size and speed adjustments.
Event Handling:

Event listeners in main.js respond to user interactions, such as changing the array size or speed, clicking the "Generate New Array" button, or selecting a sorting algorithm.
Sorting and Visualization:

When a sorting algorithm button is clicked, the corresponding sorting script (e.g., bubble_sort.js, quick_sort.js) is triggered.
The sorting algorithm processes the array, and with each step, the visualizations.js script updates the display to reflect the current state of the array.
The process continues until the array is fully sorted, providing a clear visual representation of how the algorithm works.
Customization and Expansion:

The modular design allows for easy addition of new sorting algorithms or customization of existing ones.
The visualizer can be expanded to include more complex algorithms or different types of visualizations.
Challenges and Learning:
Understanding Sorting Algorithms: Building this project required a deep understanding of various sorting algorithms and how to implement them in JavaScript.
DOM Manipulation: The project involved significant DOM manipulation to dynamically update the array visualization, which helped in mastering JavaScript's manipulation capabilities.
Performance Considerations: Implementing the algorithms in a way that balances performance with visual clarity, especially for larger arrays or more complex sorting algorithms, was a key challenge.
This project demonstrates a strong grasp of front-end development, algorithm implementation, and real-time data visualization, making it a valuable addition to your portfolio.
